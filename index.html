				My name is Elkan and i'm a programmer. I have a passion for things related to games.
			</p>

			<p>
				I also love coding. I can use some programming language, even though i'm not an expert. Some of the language that i can use is C, C++, C#, and python.
			</p>

			<p>
				Currently, i am a University student at Mulawarman University. For me, studying is quite hard, because sometimes i feel really lazy, even making this web took quite the time and effort for me. But, i would always try to finish my work right on time.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I've always loved playing games, be it RPG, puzzle, rythm, FPS, etc. I've loved playing games since i was in grade school, at the time i only played PS2 games, but after a while i started playing PC games.
			</p>

			<p>
				Sometimes, i thought to myself that i want to join a game competition, but my parents won't let me anyway, so i just gave up on joining, so instead i'm just gonna play games for fun only.
			</p>

			<p>
				And because i love games, i'm starting to think that i want to make games, and not just for myself, but i want other people to also play and enjoy it like i do.,
			</p>

			<p>
				Some people said that "games are bad for you", or that "games are bad for the children". NO, it's not the games that are bad, but how you respond and how you play the games. If you play games at your leisure time, take a break once in a while, and only play for a few hours or less, then you won't have any issues with your health. 
				<br>
				But there are some cases where someone became stressed, depressed, and even crazy because of games, but it's because most of them spend almost all of their time on games, like playing from the morning until night or stayed all night long everyday just to play, and if that's not the case then it's most likely because they spend a lot of money for the game and then the game got closed or their account got banned.
			</p>

			<p>
				Well, that's how i think anyway, and people have their way of thinking, so the answer is not always the same. But if you want to play games just remember to play it in moderation so it won't cause any problem for yourself or anyone else, and i'm sure it would be more fun that way, especially if you play it together with your friends.
